* The *start point* is the **green crosshair**.
* The *cursor position* is the **red crosshair** if inside the main polygon, **gray** if outside.
* Moving the mouse will show a line from start to the cursor.
  * It'll be **green** if the there's a *line of sight*, meaning no obstacles.
  * It'll be **gray** if not, and there'll be a **small red crosshair** at
    the first obstacle intersection, and **small gray crosshair** all subsequent
    intersections in the line of sight.
* Holding down left mouse button will show full search graph in
  **bright orange** and a **thick green path** for the found path.
* Releasing the left mouse button resets the start to there.
  * You can place the start outside the main polygon.


# How to use

Adding `scurry` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:scurry, "~> 2.0"},
  ]
end
```

Update your dependencies:

```sh-session
$ mix deps.get
```

Commit `mix.lock` file as desired.

### Vectors

In `lib/vector.ex` you'll find the basic vector operations (dot,
cross, length, add/sub) needed. A vector is a tuple of numbers, `{x, y}`.

### Lines

A line is a tuple of vectors, `{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}}`.

### Polygon

In `lib/plygon.ex` you'll find the various polygon related functions,
such as line of sight, nearest point, convex etc.

A polygon is a list of vertices (nodes) that are `{x, y}` tuples that
represent screen coordinates.

In elixir, it looks like

```elixir
polygon = [{x, y}, {x, y}, ...]
```

* The screen coordinate `0, 0` is **upper left**
* The x-axis goes **left-to-right** and y-axis **top-to-bottom**.
* Polygons **must be** defined **clockwise and not-closed**. *This is important for convex/concave vertex checks.*
* The polygon will be treated as closed with the last coordinate connected to the first.

### Polygon map

The wxwidgets demo map is loaded from a [json file](priv/complex.json), and looks like

```json
{
  "polygons": [
    "main": [
      [x, y], [x, y], [x,y], ...
    ],
    "hole1": [
      [x, y], [x, y], [x,y], ...
    ],
    "hole2": [
      [x, y], [x, y], [x,y], ...
    ]
  ]
}
```

The demo loads the polygon data, and the polygon named `main` is the
primary walking area - as complex as it needs to be.

Subsequent polygons (not named `main`) are added as holes/obstacles
within it - non-walkable areas.

Polygons *must not* be be closed (meaning last `[x, y]` json point being
equal to the first), this will be handled internally.

The polygon name isn't used internally, only by the wxwidgets demo to
pick the primary boundary and which are holes.

### Graph

The A-star graph doesn't need to be a polygon map. It just needs to be
map from `node` to a list of `{node, cost}` edges.

A `node` just has to be a term that elixir can use as a map key.

For the 2D map search, it is a map from a `vertex` (aka vectors) to a list of
`{vertex, cost}`. This is computed from the polygon map using a set
of vertices. This set is composed of;

* the main polygon's **concave** shape  (pointing *into* the world)
* the holes' **convex** shapes (point *out of( the hole, *into* the world)

and `PolygonMap.get_vertices/2` creates this.

```elixir
vertices = [
  {x1, y1} = vertex1,
  {x2, y2} = vertex2,
  {x3, y3} = vertex3,
  ...
]
```

This is transformed to a graph (`PolygonMap.create_graph/4`) given the
polygon, holes, vertices (from above) and cost function.

Assuming a `cost_fun/2` that has type `vertex, vertex :: cost`, the graph looks like;

```elixir
graph = %{
  vertex1 => [
    vertex2, cost_fun(vertex1, vertex2),
    vertex3, cost_fun(vertex1, vertex3),
    vertex4, cost_fun(vertex1, vertex4),
  ],
  # When expressed as "vertex = {x, y}" (ie. vectors)
  {x1, x2} => [
    {{x2, y2}, cost_fun({x1, y2}, {x2, y2})},
    {{x3, y3}, cost_fun({x1, y2}, {x3, y3})},
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

Note: `create_graph` uses `PolygonMap.is_line_of_sight?/3` to
determine if two vertices should have an edge. This is currently not
configurable or passed as a function. Having that functionality would
allow for configurably behaviour, such as passing through/flying over
obstacles.

The default `cost_fun` and `heur_fun` (see later) is the euclidean
distance been the two points. The difference between the two is,
`cost_fun` is used while computing the graph and `heur_fun` while
computing the path. Typically they will be the same but that is
dependent on use case.

```elixir
# Euclidean distance cost function
cost_fun = fn a, b -> Vector.distance(a, b) end
```

### A-star

In the context of A-star, we use the terminology `node` instead of
`vertex` since we're describing graphs. In the example, each node is
a polygon vertex/vector (ie. `{x, y}`).

A `node` is opaque to the algorithm, it just uses them as
keys for it's internal state maps and arguments to `heur_fun`.
indexes.

The A-star algorithm main call is `Astar.search/4` and takes.

* `graph` to search. The graph should be constructed as

```elixir
graph = %{
  node1 => [
    node2, cost_fun(node1, node2),
    node3, cost_fun(node1, node3),
    node4, cost_fun(node1, node4),
  ],
  # When doing 2d-map, nodes are vectors, {x, y}
  {x1, x2} => [
    {{x2, y2}, cost_fun({x1, y2}, {x2, y2})},
    {{x3, y3}, cost_fun({x1, y2}, {x3, y3})},
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

* `start` and `stop`, the nodes to find a path between. When doing 2d-map pathfinding, these are typically added to create a temporay graph to search, using `PolygonMap.extend/5`

* `heur_fun` function `node, node :: cost` computes the heuristic
  cost. The default is the euclidian distance.

```elixir
# Euclidean distance heuristic function
fn a, b -> Vector.distance(a, b) end
```

The state it maintains and returns

* `shortest_path_tree`, a map of edges, `node_a => node_b`,
  where `node_b` is the "previous" node from `node_a` that is
  the shortest path.

* `queue` priority queue / list `[node, node, ...]` sorted on
  the cost (see `f_cost` below) of the path from `start` to node to
  `stop`.

* `frontier` map of `node => node (prev)` that have been reached
  and edges yet to try and have been added to the `queue`. It's a map,
  so when we visit a node, we can add how we reached it to
  `shortest_path_tree`.

* `g_cost`, map `node => cost` with the minimal current cost from
  the `start` to `node`. Each iteration compare the current
  node's `g_cost` against the value in the map. If it's less, we've
  found a shorter path to this node and update the `g_cost` map.

* `f_cost`, map `node => cost` with the "total cost" of path from
  `start`, via node, to `stop`. This means the computed minimal
  cost from `start` to node (`g_cost`) plus the heuristic cost via
  `heur_fun`. This is used to reorder `queue`.

`shortest_path_tree` is the most relevant field, and can be converted
to a path using `Astar.path/1`.

Within `astar.ex`, there's two steps; search & getting the
path. `search` returns the full state, and `path` could be
extended to return the cost along the path if needed. It can fetch
this from `g_cost.`
